        <h3 class="hic-section-title">Ancient Origins: The Birth Of A Peninsula Power</h3>
        <div class="hic-section-content">
            <p>The origins of Side are a fascinating blend of indigenous Anatolian roots and the &quot;Great Colonization&quot; era of the Greeks.</p>
            <p>The Foundation Legend</p>
            <p>According to historical records—most notably those of the historian Arrian—Side was founded around the 7th century BCE (circa 600 BCE) by Greek settlers from Cyme, an Aeolian city in northwestern Anatolia.</p>
            <p>However, Side’s story has a unique twist compared to other Greek colonies:</p>
            <p>The Language Shift: Legend says that when the settlers from Cyme arrived, they almost instantly forgot their native Greek and began speaking the local indigenous dialect.</p>
            <p>The Sidetan Language: Archaeological evidence confirms this; inscriptions found in the city show a unique &quot;Sidetan&quot; script and language that remained in use until the conquests of Alexander the Great. This suggests that Side was not just a Greek outpost, but a melting pot where Greek settlers assimilated into a strong, pre-existing local culture.</p>
            <p>A Strategic Stronghold</p>
            <p>The city was built on a peninsula roughly 1 kilometer long and 400 meters wide. Its location was its greatest asset:</p>
            <p>Natural Harbors: Side possessed two harbors, making it a vital port for trade between the Eastern Mediterranean and the interior of Anatolia.</p>
            <p>Defensibility: The narrow neck of the peninsula allowed the inhabitants to build massive land walls, making it nearly impregnable by land.</p>

        <h3 class="hic-section-title">Under Persian And Lydian Shadow</h3>
        <div class="hic-section-content">
            <p>In the 6th century BCE, Side fell under the control of the Lydian Kingdom (under King Croesus) and subsequently the Achaemenid Persian Empire after Cyrus the Great&#x27;s conquest.</p>
            <p>Despite being under Persian suzerainty, Side maintained a level of autonomy. It was one of the first cities in the region to mint its own coins, often featuring the pomegranate and the head of Athena, signaling its wealth and regional influence as a maritime hub.</p>

        <h3 class="hic-section-title">The Era Of Alexander And The Hellenistic Peak</h3>
        <div class="hic-section-content">
            <p>In 333 BCE, Alexander the Great marched into Pamphylia. Side surrendered without a fight, becoming a major base for Alexander’s operations in the region.</p>
            <p>Following Alexander&#x27;s death, the city became a &quot;prize&quot; contested by the successor kingdoms:</p>
            <p>The Ptolemies and Seleucids: The city bounced between Egyptian (Ptolemaic) and Syrian (Seleucid) control.</p>
            <p>Cultural Flourishing: During this period, Side became a renowned center of culture and education. It was famous for its school of philosophy and remained a dominant maritime power.</p>

        <h3 class="hic-section-title">The Roman Golden Age And The Pirate Problem</h3>
        <div class="hic-section-content">
            <p>The 1st century BCE saw Side enter a complicated relationship with Cilician pirates. The city&#x27;s secluded harbors and lucrative markets became a primary hub for the slave trade, which the pirates facilitated.</p>
            <p>However, when Rome finally cracked down on piracy under Pompey the Great, Side transitioned into a loyal Roman province. The 2nd and 3rd centuries CE marked Side&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age.&quot; Most of the spectacular ruins seen today date from this era:</p>
            <p>The Great Theater: One of the largest in Pamphylia, seating roughly 15,000 to 20,000 people. Unlike many Greek theaters built into hillsides, this was a massive Roman structure built on vaulted arches.</p>
            <p>The Temples: The iconic Temple of Apollo and the Temple of Athena were constructed at the very tip of the peninsula, serving as beacons for sailors.</p>

        <h3 class="hic-section-title">Decline And Rediscovery</h3>
        <div class="hic-section-content">
            <p>With the rise of the Byzantine Empire, Side remained an important Christian bishopric. However, the 7th century brought a decline due to:</p>
            <p>Arab Raids: Frequent maritime attacks forced the population to shrink.</p>
            <p>Natural Disasters: Earthquakes damaged the city&#x27;s intricate aqueduct systems.</p>
            <p>Silting: The harbors eventually began to silt up, ending its era as a major port.</p>
            <p>By the 10th century, the city was largely abandoned. It wasn&#x27;t until the late 19th century that Cretan refugees established a village (Selimiye) among the ruins, leading to the modern resort town we know today.</p>
            <p>Summary Table: Key Historical Eras</p>

            <p>The Timeless Sands: A Journey Through the History of Ancient Side</p>
            <p>Side (pronounced See-deh), located on a small peninsula on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, is a living museum. Unlike many ancient cities that sit in isolated ruins, Side’s modern life is literally built on top of its Greco-Roman foundations.</p>
            <p>The name itself is a relic of an ancient Anatolian language, meaning &quot;Pomegranate,&quot; a symbol of abundance and fertility that still graces the city&#x27;s identity today.</p>
